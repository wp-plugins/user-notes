Keep private notes about each of your users that only Administrators can see.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a text editor area to each User Profile in the dashboard for Administrators to keep private notes about each User. The notes are ONLY visible to Administrators -- that's the whole point! It also adds a column to the "All Users" list where you can quickly see the note for the user without having to even open their profile.

It is especially handy for [Membership Sites](http://www.memberpress.com/?aff=20 "Best membership plugin for WordPress") where you may have thousands of members to deal with and need to remember special circumstances for them.

== Installation ==

All you'll need to do to get this setup is:

1. Install and Activate the plugin
2. Visit any Users Profile page when logged in as an Administrator. There you will see a section for "User Notes". Update your notes for that user and save their profile.

That's it!

== Changelog ==
